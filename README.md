# Sepsis Early Warning ICU (Baseline Implementation)

## Overview
This repository provides a baseline implementation of early warning for sepsis deterioration using ICU time-series data. 
It serves as a supporting project prior to the temporal reformulation explored in the main project.

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and imputation for missing values
- Classical machine learning models for classification
- Evaluation using AUROC and precision-recall metrics

## Notes
This project is primarily for method exploration and serves as a foundation for the temporal modeling approach in the main repository.
